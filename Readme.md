# Meteor-Demo Boilerplate

This template is meant to be used as a starting place for any app-like prototypes. It's a meteor app, so you'll need meteor js installed locally.

To run it, just `meteor` and then visit http://localhost:3000.

1. clone this repo.
1. delete the .git directory.
1. git init a new repo for your new thing.
1. change the SEO info in client/main.html head, like title and metadata.
1. make changes to Home.jsx. You can use Mongo (As shown in SampleDb) or not.
1. if you need settings, like api keys etc, you can create a settings.json file.
1. push your new thing to a GitHub repo in the Dome Software org.

When the app is ready, we'll deploy it to Meteor Galaxy via the GitHub repo and link it on our samples page on the dome.software site. We'll use one of their tiny Mongo dbs and adjust settings as necessary.
